_A poem for Alice, as written from the perspective of her young cousins, who themselves are too young to write._

```
My dear old cousin Alice
Living in her Kingstly palace
Heed thee oh three things I say
Upon this most auspicious day:

ONE -
Take this time of fear and panic
To sneak bagels and lox that are not organic
For we know not next whenst time may come
For us to feast on such tasty crumb

TWO -
Winter appraches lest time be forgotten
Nights spent tucked deep in to ethically-sourced cotton
The footsteps of wolves pattering toc tic toc tic
Outside, please remember to carry a stick

THREE -
Now you're three but just one, when you're four you'll be two
Take it from me to have fun while the pot's smaller to stew
Soon simplistic rhymes and your childish young verses
Will lengthen to prose as the competition diverses

So my dear old cousin Alice
Living in her Kingstly palace
Heed these wise three things I say
Whenceforth from this auspicious day!
```
