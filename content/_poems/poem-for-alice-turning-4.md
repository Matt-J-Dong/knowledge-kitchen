_A poem for Alice on the occasion of her 4th birthday._

```
Alright
you're 4.
Big deal.
I don't want to hear about it!

Tonight
you're 4.
So what?
Can't write a poem about that!

A poem that rhymes
develops, takes time
and I should be done
by the time that you're 9!

So hold onto your kittens
or horses... or not.
Sure, throw a Shabbat party
with "poems" or what.

This is the starting line
a first try
imperfect
unfinished
diminished
by youth.

But bear it in mind
that with time
the lines
get better
and deeper
and sweeter.
```
