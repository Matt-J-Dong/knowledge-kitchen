_As part of my application to be promoted to Clinical Professor in 2023, I was required to submit a personal statement. Here it is._

## Personal Statement

Teaching has always, and I hope always will be, something I enjoy. In addition to its noble purpose training others to be active members of society, this vocation has kept my interest by providing ample opportunity for self-development. I would like to apply for a promotion to Clinical Professor here at Courant to allow me to pursude the path of helping others while developing my own interests that I have been on for almost two decades at NYU.

When I first started as a teaching assistant 19 years ago in an NYU undergraduate Neuroscience course while a graduate student myself at Tisch, my focus was on overcoming a dread of public speaking as well as on making use of my own undergraduate neuroscience knowledge. Then, starting in 2005 at NYU School of Professional Studies, I taught 8 hour per day 12-day weekend crash courses in software development where, for more than a decade, I enjoyed the challenge of explaining complex concepts to a broad spectrum of people from varied backgrounds who had taken time away from their own jobs, families, and lives and had invested a lot of money to learn something new from me. Many former students, including top executives in the finance and media industries, have reported to me that these courses changed their careers and, in some cases, their lives, and this reinforced my interest in education and teaching rather than my other more commercial work, where I did not usually feel I was helping anyone.

Accumulating positions here in the CS department at Courant - first as a part-time adjunct instructor in 2011 and then as full-time faculty in 2013 - was an opportunity for me to learn the inner workings of a more formal educational system as well as to dissect and formalize my own understanding of computing and software development, learned as a child and self-taught on-the-job at tech companies. Whereas professional education could assume students to be interested and invested in their own learning, undergraduates often find themselves in courses about which they have little advance knowledge or interest. Teaching in this context thus requires a different approach, and I have enjoyed the challenge of constantly reworking my course materials and teaching methods to find a formula that sticks, even as my relationship with my students has evolved and their expectations shifted. With a moving target, one always has to anticipate and shoot a bit ahead.

Having taught well over 4,000 students in the last 19 years, I have come to believe that students learn best and are most engaged when their instructor is engaged and excited about what they teach. As many experts on Human Resources have said before, an employee's performance is usually better when they have a sense of agency and control over their work, a sense of shared mission and of being valued by their peers, and support to continue to develop themselves. As my own tenure (no, not that kind!) in this department has progressed, I have appreciated the general goodwill and comraderie of the faculty and staff and doing my part to support our positive work environment and shared mission has come naturally, but has not been without intention and effort.

In 2019, at the behest of the then-Director of Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Marsha Berger, I began co-coordinating CS101 with Prof. Bari, hiring and scheduling myriad tutors every semester (which Prof. Bari primarily handles) and ensuring that the many adjuncts, postdocs, and full-time faculty teaching this course hit upon a shared set of core learning goals and have example syllabi, schedules, quizzes, and lecture notes from which to base their own materials. In addition to initial setup each semester, Prof. Bari and I give regular guidance to instructors throughout the term.

Starting in 2021, Prof. Berger also asked me to mentor new adjuncts and faculty fellows - something that I continue to do today. In trying to explain "how things work here" to contract faculty and answer their most basic questions, I realized that so little of the institutional knowledge I had gained over the years in the CS department was documented, at least not in a format that was easily discoverable, which prevented new faculty from becoming fully engaged and empowered in the roles. So, to resolve that, I wrote the "[Quick Guide for Contract Faculty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ydm6bPbqceop99PxmKBPRtqHzbfnU9-zrdvrF4t3B1g/edit?usp=sharing)" - a somewhat concise overview of the people, processes, systems, and expecations of contract faculty in the department. With the help of colleagues who ocassionally provide feedback and suggestions, this document has continued to evolve and, anecdotally, it has proved valuable to some faculty new and old.

In October 2020, surprised by the apparent lack of inclusion of Clinical faculty voices in drafting earlier Clinical Faculty Reappointments & Promotions Policies, I ran and was elected to serve on the committee tasked by Director Caflisch with drafting a new such policy. Working closely for over two years with Profs. Ernie Davis and Anasse Bari of Computer Science, and Profs. Shafer Smith, Shizhu Liu, and Elizabeth Steppe of Math, we extensively researched earlier Courant policies, other schools' policies, national trends, the activities of the Contract Faculty Senators Council and we interviewed almost all contract faculty in both departments to find out their concerns and hopes for a new policy. Ultimately, our committee submitted a draft policy to Dr. Caflisch in February 2021. In August of that year, leadership put up for vote a very different policy that did not address most of the concerns we had discovered among the contract faculty, and unsusprisingly this policy was resoundingly voted down by the contract faculty. Director Caflisch again invoked the committee to help draft another version, and in May 2022, after hundreds of hours of meetings, draft revisions, and ongoing discussions with Director Caflisch, a [new policy](https://cims.nyu.edu/media/cims/filer_public/f9/0a/f90aba15-ebbb-4392-b99c-d95d45b66c29/courant_contract_faculty_policy_12_20_2022.pdf) accompanied by an important [a memo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fCiw8dsAZ_BCVht5Xz2xs1NY2R8g8hI3/view?usp=sharing) from the Director was put up for vote that finally addressed many of the concerns our committee had discovered, and it easily passed. In December, 2022, over two years after we started, the new policy was approved by the Provost with minor revisions and came into effect. This new policy governs my own application here for promotion. (PS: you will note that the policy says nothing of letters of support, although I have just now found out that they are customarily included in applications for promotion - someone should fix that!)

Continuing what I believed to be unfinished business regarding contract faculty's inclusion in their own governance at Courant, to give a sense of agency in their work to allow them to excel, in October 2022, I ran and was elected to the Courant Governance Committee, which Director Caflisch has requested draft a policy governing various committes within the Institute. Our work is currently ongoing and I take my role as an elected representative of the contract faculty to heart and continue to respectfully lobby for inclusion of contract faculty in their own governance within bounds that are acceptable to all and sensible for the betterment of the Institute as a whole as well as for contract faculty individually. While I have yet to encounter anybody who opposes basic contract faculty rights, this has not historically been a concern of the Institute and thus requires continual effort and vigilance to shift the culture to meet the reality of the composition of today's higher education workforce.

With mentoring and well-documented procedures to help new contract faculty, the new policy for reappointment and promotion and an upcoming policy for governance that treat contract faculty as valued partners in the Institute's shared mission, entrusted with the agency to oversee some of their own affairs, I believe we will have made the Institute a better workplace where instructors can dedicate more focus on pedagogy with the support they need to perform well, develop themselves, and give students the quality they deserve.

I hope it goes without saying that my dedication to pedagogy, joy in tweaking systems and evaluating the results, and of passing on valuable knowledge to students has required constant curriculum development, professional development, and collaboration with faculty and staff colleagues, including the creation of three completely new popular elective courses: Agile Software Development & DevOps, Software Engineering, Physical Computing (which has not been taught recently) as well as vast revisions to the Database Design & Implementation course.

In addition to my activities within Courant, I have kept abreast of developments in the software industry, winning [an award](https://www.effie.org/case_database/case/US_2021_E-6247-050) in 2021 for my design of an application made for Iceland's tourism board and consulting in 2022 with CBRE, the world's largest real estate company.
