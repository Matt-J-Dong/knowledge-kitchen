_As part of my application to be promoted to Clinical Professor in 2023, I was required to submit a personal statement. Here it is._

## Personal Statement

Teaching has always, and I hope always will be, something I enjoy. In addition to its noble purpose training others to be active members of society, this vocation has kept my interest by providing ample opportunity for self-development.

When I first started almost two decades ago as a teaching assistant in an NYU undergraduate Neuroscience course while a graduate student myself at Tisch, my focus was on overcoming a dread of public speaking as well as on brushing up and making use of my own neuroscience knowledge. Then, starting in 2005 at NYU School of Professional Studies, I taught 8 hour per day 12-day weekend crash courses in web development where, for more than a decade, I enjoyed the challenge of explaining complex concepts to a broad spectrum of people from varied backgrounds who had taken time away from their own jobs, families, and lives and had invested a lot of money to learn something new. Many former students, including top executives in the finance and media industries, have reported to me that these courses changed their careers and, in some cases, their lives, reinforcing my desire to continue teaching.

Switching to undergraduate education here in the CS department - first as a part-time adjunct instructor in 2011 and then as full-time faculty in 2013 - was an opportunity for me to learn the inner workings of a more formal educational system as well as to dissect and formalize more of the knowledge I had gained about computing and software development first as a hobby as a child, and then on-the-job as a self-taught software developer and designer. Whereas professional education could assume students to be interested and invested in their own learning, undergraduates often find themselves in courses about which they have little advance knowledge or interest. Teaching in this context thus requires a different approach, and I have enjoyed the challenge of constantly reworking my course materials and teaching methods to find a formula that sticks as my relationship with my students has evolved.

Having taught well over 4,000 students in the last 19 years, I have come to believe that students learn best and are most engaged when their instructor is also excited and engaged. As with any occupation, a teacher's performance is best when the instructor has a sense of agency and control over their work, a sense of being valued by their peers and administration, some support to continue to develop themselves further, and a feeling of security in their position. As my own tenure (no, not that kind!) in this department has progressed, I have appreciated the general goodwill and comraderie of the faculty and doing my part to support our positive working environment has come naturally.

Starting in 2021, at the behest of the then-Director of Undergraduate Studies to mentor new adjuncts and faculty fellows which I have continued to this day.
