_This letter to the editor was sent to The Croton Cortlandt Gazette in response to prior letters complaining about the amount of time and money the village of Croton-on-Hudson had spent creating a bike lane on a busy road when only a minority of residents bicycle._

## Letter

Dear Editor,

In this time of elections and seasonal generosity, it is also exam time in many schools and universities. I hope you'll forgive me - I've written a short Quiz - 10 simple questions - for your readers to give to their young children over the holidays. Perhaps this will help hone their ability to make the important decisions that will surely arise within their own communities in their own day. Any similarity in this Quiz to to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

1. In a small village, named after a long-gone indigenous tribe who walked a lot, a group of concerned citizens have counted the number of pedestrians who walk back and forth down an important road. They have concluded that no more than 30 pedestrians travel back and forth down the road every day. Based on police reports published in a local print-only newspaper, an average of two pedestrians are hit by cars on this road each year. What percentage chance does any given pedestrian have of being hit by a car within any given year on this road?

2. Based on the safety issue mentioned in Question 1, village leadership contracted a consultant to estimate the cost of improving safety on this road. The consultant estimated the cost at $3 million. Given that there are 3,000 households in this little village, how much will this project cost each household?

3. If the village leadership can win a federal grant to cover $1.2 million of the total cost of this project, how much will it cost each household to prevent people from being hit by cars on this road?

4. The leadership has won the government grant. Wary of asking the local population to pay for the remainder of the project cost, the leadership has arranged to borrow the amount from the answer to Question 3 from the bank at a historically low interest rate of 4% per year, repayable over 30 years. How much will each household pay per year under this plan?

5. Assuming that completion of the project goes according to plan, and the small number of people being hit by cars are no longer being hit by cars on this road, what is the amount paid each year of the 30-year loan term by each household in order to prevent each pedestrian from being hit?

6. How does the amount from the answer to Question 5 compare to the amount of money your parents spent on Christmas gifts to people who were not hit by cars while walking this year?

7. The village leaders have been accused of allocating $20,000 of village funds to their own personal benefit. A new aspiring "dream team" leadership, consisting of the same group of concerned citizens who so diligently counted pedestrians back in Question 1, would like to become the new village leadership. What questions might you ask of them to determine their fitness to make decisions concerning pedestrian safety and public finances?

8. Due to the political turmoil from Question 9, in addition to the general apathy among the approximately 8,000 village residents who do not walk up and down this road every day, it has now been a year since the project cost was originally estimated by the consultant, yet nothing has happened. Since that time, the interest rates on loans such as those mentioned in Question 4 have increased by 0.5%. Interest rates are expected to increase by another 0.5% at the end of the coming year. How much more will each household pay, per year, on the project, compared to the original estimate, if the amount is not borrowed from the bank and the project is not begun before the end of the coming year?

9. The new village leadership has been elected. A widely held view within the village is that they won the election not because of their answers to such difficult and confusing questions, but rather because of the doubt surrounding the ethics of the previous village leaders, as mentioned in Question 7. The new leadership has decided to cancel the proposed project. Imagine you were them - how would you justify this decision based on the ethical and financial issues involved?

10. Another widely held view among the village population is that increasing the safety of this road will increase the number of pedestrians on this road. For every additional pedestrian who walks back and forth each day on this road, how much does this change the answer to Question 5 - the amount that each household pays per year to prevent a pedestrian from being hit by a car.
