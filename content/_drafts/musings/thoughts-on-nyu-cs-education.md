_Notes for meeting with Director of Undergraduate Studies at NYU's Computer Science Department._

## Our undergrad program's current state of affairs

### The opportunity

We currently have great opportunity in undergrad and grad:

- technology is disrupting the economy across industries
- media can't stop talking about it: disruption, hacking, social activism, innovation, automation
- new era of social networking, quantum computing, ubiquity, cryptocurrencies, etc
- decline of traditional industries/careers while tech-driven automation grows and becomes incorporated
- as a result, we have a massive and growing number of students intrigued by computers or pressured to study CS

### The constraints

Our program nevertheless has major constraints:

- insufficient classroom space
- struggle to find faculty for intro courses
- administration harried and (maybe) overworked
- trouble hiring faculty to teach undergrad courses given better-paying opportunities in industry
- undergrad is not a money-maker like grad is for the department, so little incentive to change things... we don't get more money from the university for more students
- worry about the risk of messing up our good thing if we make changes (i.e. short term view of cost/benefit of innovation)

### Our customers

We have a wide variety of student (a.k.a customer) ambitions:

- future CS academics
- future software engineers
- future entrepreneurs
- future arts/humanities creatives
- future scientists
- future finance/business personnel
- future traditional office workers

### Our reflexive response

We are calcifying rather than embracing this opportunity:

- this is a typical reflex when overwhelmed by circumstances
- reliance on "traditional" CS courses for all students, despite their irrelevancy of this material to many of their ambitions
- rather than put TAs in recitations for our entry courses, use over-qualified professors during precious class time in a so-called "flipped classroom" for the same purpose.
- we give adjuncts course plans for our entry courses, which are rigid and difficult to stray without wrecking the "system" even by skilled teachers who should be able to teach their own way
- tightening of belts on faculty (expiring professional dev funds, permission not granted to teach elsewhere, limits on side income)
- [as Donald Norman would say](https://knowledge.kitchen/Interaction_design#Beauty_vs._ugliness), stress leads to depth-first narrow thinking, rather than breadth-first creative problem solving

### A paucity of options

We are funneling this hugely diverse variety of students through
rigid/old-fashioned paths do not reflect current situation:

- CS major (good for future grad students... relatively narrow and restrictive for others)
- CS minor (not sure who this is tailored for... perhaps good for future grad students)
- CS web dev minor (does not get close to web dev competence)
- Joint majors/minors with Math and Econ, primarily for finance/business students
- There's nothing for software engineers / entrepreneurs / scientists / artists... how can we miss this opportunity at this time in history?!

### Audiences left in the lurch

The options we do have leave major gaps for other audiences:

- software engineers
- entrepreneurs
- arts/humanities/scientists/creatives

## The encroaching competition

Other departments/schools are happy to pick up our slack... is this
desirable?

- Stern undergrad/grad
- ITP/IMA undergrad/grad
- Tandon computer engineering
- Game Center
- The various fabrication, entrepreneurship and innovation labs around campus
- The myriad universities and private organizations teaching more a applied engineering aspect of CS

## Stepping back or stepping through

Perhaps this is a good time to step back and decide what we want our
program to be holistically

- who are we serving and what do we want them to learn/do?
- determine our program's stance on the benefits/risks of current trends in education: online courses, use of textbooks, so-called "flipped" classrooms, etc.
- figure out how we integrate with other departments offering the same or related courses

## How we might improve

### Diversity

Diversify student paths:

- Joint major: CS+X ([like at Stanford](https://majors.stanford.edu/more-ways-explore/joint-majors-csx))... more than just joint with Econ and Math
- New major: Software Engineering
- Create building blocks for well-rounded computer people of all stripes, not just aspiring CS academics

### Fix the bottom of the funnel

Remove Intro to Computer Programming (0002) from requirement for Intro
to Computer Science (101)

- many, if not most, students in 101 are no better off for having spent an entire semester on 0002
- or make it easier for good students to skip this, regardless of whether they have programmed a computer before
  - I wager that a large proportion of students who do well in 0002 would not do well on the 101 placement test... this is patently unfair
- The message we send to beginning students is contradictory...
  - does CS require minimal effort, and will their hands be held the entire way, or do they have to start teaching themselves under our guidance?
  - do we want students who can do supervised and unsupervised learning, or those who do exactly what we tell them to do and nothing more?

### Limit the effect assignments have on overall grades

We know students share code rampantly and that solutions to many of our assignments are posted online on sites like course-hero, chegg, reddit, Facebook groups, and many other venues... new solutions can be bought, etc. We should admit that we have no control over this at all (the internet exists... for now).

By counting assignment scores, we set up an ethically-problematic and not uncommon scenario:

- a good student who does their own work but does it imperfectly will score lower than a student who plagiarizes and has perfect scores on assignments
- we all know this happens... this is resolved simply by only grading work we can verify that the student has done themselves: exams, in-person exercises, oral exams... I'm sure we can do better with a bit of effort
- to be fair, some students claim not to test well, and who's to say this is not true. but accommodating this requires a more holistic approach, not just giving incentive to plagiarizers.

### Teach engineering

Teach software engineering for future software engineers /
entrepreneurs:

- development methodologies (agile, scrum vs waterfall, etc)
- industry standard practices (version control, testing, continuous integration, configuration management, automation, etc)
- app architectures
- working with a larger team
- diving into existing messy codebases, rather than starting everything from scratch
- integrate with Tandon to offer a wider range of options
- integrate with other departments to teach how to solve typical use-cases across many industries
- pull our industry contacts to give real-world problems to students

### Teach best practices

Integrate best practices throughout all courses (a la
<http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3130216>)

- unix command line
- [git version control](https://knowledge.kitchen/Version_control_with_Git_and_GitHub) / github or similar collaboration platforms
- project management concepts
- familiarity with internet and web architecture and technologies (it should be an embarrassment that many majors can't even make a decent web page whether manually or not!)
- continuous automated builds and tests (e.g. Jenkins build, test, deploy cycles)
- ethical issues in technology: privacy, security, equal access
- I'm sure we can come up with a set of "threads" that run through all courses, not just try to teach them as blocks in a single course

## How my experience as a faculty member might improve

### Have a plan for our departmental growth

Perhaps create faculty committee on sustainable growth

- how to deal with influx of students while not sacrificing quality
- how to try out new ideas in curricula and education without multi-year cycles for any small change
- how to offer a wider variety of undergrad courses, while still covering core material

### Leverage my personal expertise

I can be more useful:

- project management, app-building, user research, experience/service design, software architecture

### Let me learn

Diversify what I teach

- I learn through teaching:
  - Grad courses in software design and management
  - Stern courses in applied computing
  - Work my way through majors courses to complete my own CS teaching education
  - I would like to create a path of courses tailored to software engineers

### Reward me for my level of expertise

Increase pay / promotion:

- I've been teaching for almost 15 years: first 9 years as adjunct, 5 years now as clinical
- I teach a wide variety: database design, web apps, cs101, web design, simple electronics, HCI/interaction design, basic programming
- I have 20 years professional experience as software engineer, entrepreneur, app-maker, researcher, designer
- I have worked with colleagues to design all the courses with which I am involved (except 0002, which is Craig Kapp's baby!)
- I now earn a teaching salary that is similar to what my students are offered on the first day of the entry-level positions I help them attain
- I would like to get a raise to make this job more self-sufficient
  - Many of us clinical professors work side gigs on our days off to supplement our pay, which says something about the state of education, especially in a well-funded department like this.
