Château Bloomberg is a multi-generational family-operated maker of fine
fermented beverages, including
[wineberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_phoenicolasius) wine,
[damson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damson) wine, and apple cider. All fruit
is hand-picked, and foraged in the wild (except for the apples, which
come from an orchard). Unlike almost all bottles you're likely to buy
at your local wine shop, most things here are fermented naturally with
no added yeasts, acids, stabilizers, or other additives. Through
trial-and-error, the picking of only quality fruit, and a bit of luck,
we are generally able to produce quality alcoholic beverages using what
we find in the nearby forests and fields.

## 2018 and beyond

We continue to produce much in the same manner as outlined below.

## 2017 Vintage

### Wineberry Grand Cru

- 6.9 gallons produced.
- Au Naturel is completely organic with native yeasts and intense natural flavor.
- Made entirely from the juice of foraged wineberries, with only organic sugar added.
- Fermented to complete dryness.
- The berry juice is not sterilized, and we use no additives for Au Naturel. This gives it a unique taste that differs from one batch to the next, but it is always intense!

### Damson Wine

- 1 gallon produced.
- Foraged from damsons we happened to come across growing deliciously wild in Kazakhstan.
- No yeasts or other additives besides non-organic beet sugar found at the local corner store.
- No measurements were made, and everything was done with blind faith in the [master vintner](Amos_Bloomberg)'s expertise.
- This wine is currently aging in the basement of a Soviet-era planned "microdistrict" in Almaty, and is available to ship internationally.

glass fermenters, and made according to standards far exceeding most
vineyards. Label not designed yet. ![Château Bloomberg 2013 Wineberry

- 5 gallons produced.
- Vin Du Banane uses organic imported bananas mixed with foraged wineberries, topped up with organic sugar water to create valhalla for yeasts. The fermentation is very robust!

- Despite containing bananas, Vin Du Banane otherwise follows the same fermentation process as Ordinaire.
