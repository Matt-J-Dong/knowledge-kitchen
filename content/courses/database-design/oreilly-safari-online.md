title: Accessing books with O'reilly Safari Online
---

Thanks to [Professor Matthew Zeidenberg](https://www.mattzeidenberg.com/) for these notes.

How to get Safari Online (with NYU license) to work in the Oâ€™Reilly App:

- Start [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/), on your computer. Click on the "Select your institution" dropdown, but choose the very first option: "Not listed? Click here."
- Enter your NYU email address, then click "Let's Go". It will give you temporary access to Safari, but more importantly, about 30-60 minutes later, you'll get an email from them, asking you to set a password for your new account.
- Log in to the O'Reilly app using the NYU email address you entered and the password you just set.
