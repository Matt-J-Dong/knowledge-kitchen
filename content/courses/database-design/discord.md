Discord is a messenger / discussion application that we use for all course communication.

## Roles

Every user is assigned a role.

- `admins` - graders, tutors, any course assistants, and the instructor are all given this role
- `graders` - graders are given this role
- `tutors` - tutors are given this role
- `students` - students are given this role

It is possible to send a message to all users with a specific role by including @role in the message, e.g. @graders.

## Channels

An overview of the channels used in this course.

### General Channels:

- `admin` - a channel for the admins to converse
- `data-dibs` - a channel where students can "claim" particular data sets they intend to use
- `exams` - a channel for discussion related to exams
- `general` - a channel for general conversation
- `grading` - a channel moderated by the graders for discussion about grading
- `pronouncements` - a channel for official announcements from the admins... only admins should post here
- `quizzes` - a channel for discussion about quizzes
- `random` - random discussion
- `tutoring` - a channel moderated by the tutors for discussion about tutoring

### Student Work:

- `assgn_fb1258` - each student must create a private channel and invite the admins - replace `fb1258` with your own NYU Net ID.

## Rules

To keep discussions orderly and focused, abide by the following rules:

1. students should never post to the `pronouncements` channel - keep this for official announcements only
1. if you are targeting a message to a specific person, use the `@username` syntax to notify them, e.g. `Dear @Prof - great to see you!`
1. if a message is related to your personal performance or grades, send it as a private message in your private channel
1. direct questions about grading to the graders - they have the word, "`Grader`", in their usernames
1. direct questions about tutoring to the tutors - they have the word, "`Tutor`", in their usernames
1. direct questions about other matters to the professor (`@Prof`) and the course assistant if there is one for this course - they have the word, "`Course Assistant`", in their username
