## Fonts

Try different font combinations for headings and body copy. Some people like to use serif fonts for headings and sans-serif fonts for body copy. Some people prefer the opposite.

## Colors

There are many sites that feature nice color combinations dreamed up by talented designers. Try basing your design choices on any color pattern you like.

- [Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/explore/newest/) - is one such site that features nice color combinations you can use for your pages.
- [colourlovers.com](http://colourlovers.com) - another one

## Composition

The alignment of graphical components and their relative positions, sizes, and proportions can affect the "interestingness" of a given design. In particular, try playing around with:

- grouping
- repetition
- alternation
- radiation
- the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Design)
- the [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds)

## Images

The foreground and background images you choose have a huge impact on the impression your design makes. Never compromise on image quality, unless you are intentionally going for the "poor quality" look.

- use the image in its original proportions
- verify the [dimensions]](/content/courses/web-design/slides/digital-imagery/#29) match your needs
- make sure the [resolution]](/content/courses/web-design/slides/digital-imagery/#30) is suitable for your use
