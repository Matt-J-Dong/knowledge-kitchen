When you have not been paid in a timely manner...

1. ask your contact nicely
1. ask your contact again nicely
1. inform your contact and his/her manager that this is the last time you're asking nicely - give an ultimatum
1. ask the person who put you in touch with them, and anyone else who knows both parties, to intervene
1. let everyone you know who knows them or has heard of them what kind of shits they are - focus your smear campaign on the individuals involved, not just the company
1. make an SEO optimized site documenting your problems with them
1. have a lawyer write them a threatening letter
1. file a suit in small claims court
1. actually go to court
1. take matters into your own hands
