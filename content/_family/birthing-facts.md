Reliable statistics on labor and birth are surprisingly hard to find. Here are the best I have so far.

More than a third of births in the United States are done by cesarean section surgery.

- [From 1996 to 2007, the rate of cesarean surgery increased by 53%](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm).
- Most ['urgent' cesareans happen during the day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12929294), not at night.
  - Conflicting theories to explain this include: involvement of women's natural circadian rhythms, and the theory that doctors don't want to work during suppertime.
- Some estimates say that [half of all cesareans are medically unnecessary](http://www.childbirth.org/section/avoid.html), and only the rare few are elective
- Fewer than [10% of births to women who have previously undergone a cesarean are vaginal births](http://www.childbirthconnection.org/article.asp?ck=10554). In 1994, that number was greater than 26%.
  - more than [80% of women who have previously undergone a cesarean are estimated to be in fine shape for future vaginal births](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/1001/p1397.html).

More than [80% of women are given drugs to either speed up or induce labor](http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/LTMII_report.pdf)

- the drug most often used to speed up or induce labor is [Pitocin](http://www.childbirth.org/articles/pit.html), a synthetic form of oxytocin
- Pitocin-induced labor involves more intense uterine contractions than natural labor, where oxytocin is not released in such a steady dose
- Pitocin can restrict blood flow to the uterus, which increases the risk of further complications and medical interventions
- with an IV drip and fetal monitoring device, these women are either totally or partially restricted in movement, which exaggerates the pain

[86% of women are given some form of pain medication](http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/LTMII_report.pdf) to deal with painful contractions

- 76% of all women are given either epidural anesthetic or spinal analgesia for the pain
- epidural anesthetic [removes the woman's body's ability to respond to the sensations labor](http://pregnancy.about.com/od/secondstagepushing/p/pushingepidural.htm)
- 41% of women given epidural anesthetic feel a strong need to 'push', while 77% of women undergoing natural births feel that sensation.
- an anesthetized woman in labor becomes further immobile, which means she cannot easily assume a natural position for labor
- epidural anesthetic can sometimes cause a drop in the mother's blood pressure, requiring intervention
- 1/4 of all women report walking around sometime after being admitted to hospital
- the numbing effect of the epidural anesthetic generally increases the amount of time required for labor
- longer labor time increases the chances that the doctor will perform a cesarean surgery, use forceps or a vacuum suction, and/or cut the vagina (i.e. an episiotomy) to enable the easier extraction of the fetus

[Intra-venous pain medication given to the mother during labor crosses into the blood stream into the fetus](http://voices.yahoo.com/pain-medications-used-childbirth-effects-mother-3464615.html), increasing the chance of side-effects in the newborn, including:

- low blood pressure in either or both the child and the mother
- drowsiness and drug-induced cognitive underperformance in newborn for up to several days after birth
- increased chance that the newborn will require medical resuscitation upon birth, due to difficulty breathing
- increased chance of the newborn having liver or kidney problems due to metabolizing the medications
- [inability to properly breastfeed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091218294900973), due to residual narcotics in breast milk, and the medicated baby's inability to properly latch to the breast.
