Recreational running, off-road electric unicycling, and biking while enjoying the scenery is my
preferred style. I never enjoyed running at all until my 30's. Here are some more details and a few races I have enjoyed participating in.

## Unicycling

After seeing a distant cousin riding a unicycle as a child, I was enthralled and spent countless hours, days, weeks, months teaching myself to ride. Eventually, I began to ride to/from school and all about town. This paused once I entered a high school too far to reach within a reasonable amount of time on one wheel.

Three decades later, I visited a friend who showed me an electric unicycle sitting in his garage. After about 10 minutes riding it, I fell off the wagon and relapsed into a downward spiral of unicycle addiction from which I have not yet recovered. As of the time of this writing, I ride a standard KingSong S18 with an IRC TR-1 knobby tire, enjoying street riding to/from work as well as off-roading on local trails.

## Harry Chapin 10k Run Against Hunger

The Bloomberg family, particularly my dad, has been running in this
local Croton-on-Hudson race, on-and-off, for as long as I can remember.
It's a tough 10k race with many hills. The course passes over the
beautiful [New Croton Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Croton_Dam) and
surrounding area.

Here is a plot of a few of our family members' performance from 2009 to
2018, the only years for which I have records:

## Triathlons

Despite being a terrible swimmer, a mediocre runner and bicyclist, and
someone who generally does not wear speedos in public, I competed in
triathlons for several years Triathlons can be brutal to a normal
person, but are a nice test of endurance.

### 2012 Black Bear Sprint Triathlon

The Black Bear triathlon has a beautiful course through hills and
forests around [Beltzville State Park,
PA](http://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/BeltzvilleStatePark).
While it is a grueling race, it's a breathtaking place to be out of
breath.

### 2011 NYC Triathlon

My timer chip fell off somewhere during the race, so I have no timed
results. I nearly passed out at the end. The New York City triathlon has
a swim segment through the Hudson River next to the city, which is one
of the most putrid places I've ever been in my life

- you can smell an indescribable stench underwater.

### And more

There are others for which I cannot find records.
