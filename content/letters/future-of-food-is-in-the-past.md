[Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food), [organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food), [vegan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism), [vegetarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian), [macrobiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobiotic). These are all quaint notions of what food should be.   But they are also a denial of progress, a sentimental pining for what is mistakenly perceived to have been a simpler, healthier past.   Some of their food is quite delicious, and much of the other diets of contemporary western society are inarguably atrocious in both flavor and composition, but that is not the point.   Their followers are [culinary recidivists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivist).   What they lack is imagination and what they exude is a fear of the unknown.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of world travel is the sampling of local cuisine.   As travel becomes ever more affordable and information, including culinary habits, spreads globally at an ever-increasing pace, we experimental eaters have limited time to sample the flavors of the world before idiosyncratic crafts are wiped out by the homogenizational watering-down force of global connectedness.

Not only are authentic culinary traditions lost daily, despite the ever increasing number of cookbooks published, but so too are the ingredients with which they are traditionally prepared.   As human tastes change, so too do the fruits, vegetables, and animals that we call food evolve, pick up new traits, and adapt to changes in climate, soil, agricultural techniques, and the availability of nutrients.   A tomato today almost certainly looks and tastes nothing like [the tomato the Aztecs ate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato#History_and_distribution).   The onslaught of economic forces, population shifts, technological advances, genetic modification, climate change, cultural trends, and information technology, have always, and will continue to always destroy or modify existing culinary traditions.   Until now, that historic lineage of human foodstuffs has been mostly lost to the wind.

Today, a variety of lines of technological development and scientific understanding are leading us progressively towards a milestone where it may soon be proven possible to recreate those lost culinary traditions and to clone those lost ingredients.   Cloning is currently all the rage.   Geneticists talk of [resussitating long-extinct species](http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/science/11/04/japan.mouse.clone/index.html).   Although there is currently a high risk of complications, geneticists will undoubtedly soon perfect cloning technology for a variety of species, including humans, and it's not inconceivable to talk about the eventual cloning of extinct species.   Although most cloning news, for sensational reasons, focuses on mammals, advances in human understanding of genetics are also applicable to the recreation of ancient fruits, vegetables, grains, and other ingredients of a typical human meal.

Of course, reconstructing the genetic makeup of historic animals and plants is only half the battle to a culinary trip back in time.   Nature and nurture work together, so if we are to successfully sample the delicacies that [homo habilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_habilis) ate during the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene), or any other peoples in any other era, we would need to recreate the environmental conditions that nurtured the ingredients of their food.

Fortunately, our ability to make detailed conclusions about the climate of any period in Earth's history by sampling the [composition of soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemical) samples, [fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology), and other artifacts from any period, is also becoming very sophisticated.   It is now possible to say with some certainty what the general nutrient and climate conditions were like in most places on earth at any given time in the past.   We would therefore presumably know, with the proper research, under what conditions the Aztec tomato grew.   Combining this with genetic research would allow us to sow the seeds to produce a near replica.

One can only assume that these and other technologies will make the eating of reconstructed foods a reality in the not-so-distant future.   For example, in addition cloning, geneticists are now able to trace the [commonality in the DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor) of any two human beings to establish certain facts about the genetic makeup of their shared ancestor.   Although they are currently not able to deduce the exact sequence of DNA in that ancestor, maybe one day we will be able to reconstruct their approximate genetic makeup by performing a large cross-analysis of the genetic makeup of a population of descendants from the common ancestor.     Performing such an analysis could help fill in any gaps in our knowledge of the exact genetic construction of any fruit, vegetable, or animal on the planet at any time in the past.

Reconstructed Foods... eat like a Mesopotamian.
